## About Pygame

Pygame is a free and open-source library used for building 2D games. It provides simple tools to handle graphics, sounds, and user input (like keyboard and mouse), so you can focus on game logic without dealing with low-level details.

--- 

## Games Included 

- Snake
- Flappy Bird
- Space Shooter

Each game is kept separate under games folder so it's easier to read the code and make changes if you want to experiment.
